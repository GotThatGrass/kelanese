This chapter describes the verbal morphology of Kelanese. Verbs inflect for tense, aspect, and modality, but do not inflect for person or number, unlike many common geocentrical languages. Subject reference is inferred from discourse context.

## 3.1 Verb Forms and the Infinitive

The **infinitive (dictionary) form** of a verb ends in **`-tel`**:

`aitel`, `kiaktel`, `zulmantel`, `poitel`, `səttel`

> **Rule:** The `-tel` form is **nominal**. It cannot function as a finite verb without further morphology.

All finite verb forms are derived from a verbal stem, typically obtained by removing the infinitive suffix `-tel`.

## 3.2 Introduction to Verb Stems and Suffixes

### 3.2.1 Finite Suffixes

| Suffix | Example | Function                                        |
| ------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `-n`   | `ain`   | Non-past: present, future, imperative, habitual |
| `-lah` | `ailah` | Past tense (simple or continuous)               |
| `-soe` | `aisoe` | Volitional (“let’s …”)                          |
| `-mae` | `aimae` | Interrogative (“do …?”)                         |

> **Note:** The `-n` suffix is the **default finite form** and is used whenever no explicit tense marking is required.

The suffixes may be stacked to a degree. For example:

`ai + -mae + -lah -> aimaelah` = "Did we ...?"

### 3.2.2 Non-finite and Structural Forms

| Form      | Example | Function                  |
| --------- | ------- | ------------------------- |
| `-tel`    | `aitel` | Infinitive / nominal form |
| bare stem | `ai`    | Truncated or derived stem |

Bare stems do not occur independently as finite verbs but may appear in derivation or compounding.

## 3.3 Introduction to Prefixes: Aspect, Negation, and Emphasis

Prefixes attach directly to the verbal stem or stem+suffix complex. Multiple prefixes may **stack** on a single verb.

| Prefix | Meaning / Effect                            |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `ci-`  | Continuous / progressive (“am/is/are …ing”) |
| `moh`  | Abstract or remote future                   |
| `pe-`  | Standard negation (“don’t / didn’t”)        |
| `mai`  | Absolute negation (“never”)                 |
| `ko-`  | Perfect / completed action (“have …ed”)     |
| `ueh`  | Emphatic / intensifier                      |

> **Prefix Stacking Order (typical):**  
> **Negation → Aspect → Emphasis → Verb**  
> e.g. `mai ko cihain`

> **Note:** Prefix order is somewhat flexible in expressive or poetic contexts, but negation most often precedes aspect in neutral prose.

### 3.2.3 Combined Forms and Examples

The following examples illustrate common tense, aspect, and modal combinations.

---

#### Core Tense Forms

| Form            | Example   | Meaning                                   |
| --------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Non-past        | `ain`     | I love you / I will love you              |
| Past            | `ailah`   | I loved you                               |
| Abstract future | `moh ain` | I will love you (distant or hypothetical) |

---

#### Continuous Aspect

|Form|Example|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|Present continuous|`cihain`|I am loving you|
|Past continuous|`cihailah`|I was loving you|
|Future continuous|`moh cihain`|I will be loving you|

---

#### Emphasis and Completion

|Form|Example|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|Emphatic|`ueh cihain`|I _will_ love you (insistent)|
|Perfect|`kohain`|I have loved you before|

---

#### Interrogatives

|Form|Example|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|Interrogative|`aimaen`|Do I love you?|
|Negative interrogative|`pehaimaelah`|Did I not love you?|

---

#### Negation

|Form|Example|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|Present negation|`pehain`|I don’t love you|
|Past negation|`pehailah`|I didn’t love you|
|Absolute negation|`mai kohailah`|I never loved you|

---

#### Volitional Forms

|Form|Example|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|Volitional|`aisoe`|Let’s love!|
|Rhetorical neg. volitional|`aimesoe`|Don’t I love you? (rhetorical)|

---

### 3.2.4 Notes on Usage

1. Prefixes may stack freely with tense and aspect morphology.
    
    - `ci-` + `moh` + verb → future continuous
        
    - `mai` + `ko-` + verb → never have …ed
        
2. The continuous prefix `ci-` may combine with either `-n` or `-lah` to express present or past continuous aspect.
    
3. Volitional suffix `-soe` may combine with negation or interrogative morphology to express rhetorical or emphatic intent.

> **Summary:** Keltunic verbal morphology prioritizes **aspectual and modal clarity** over agreement, relying on context rather than inflection to determine subject reference.
