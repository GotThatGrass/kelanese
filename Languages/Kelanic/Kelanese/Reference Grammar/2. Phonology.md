## 2.1 Overview

The pronunciation outlined in this reference grammar is referred to as *General Kelanese*. General Kelanese functions as an umbrella variety encompassing the shared phonological features observed across Kelanese dialects and accents. Distinct regional varieties are not treated in detail here and will be addressed in a separate document.

The phonological system of General Kelanese is characterized by a moderate consonant inventory and a comparatively compact vowel system. Articulatorily, the language favors clear segmental contrasts over complex consonant clustering, resulting in a sound profile that is generally smooth, though punctuated by several marked or atypical realizations.

Vocalic contrast in General Kelanese appears to be based primarily on vowel

### 2.2.2 Vowels

A table containing the vowel phonemes and its common variations and/or allophones is given below.

Vowels in Kelanese are generally separated into two varieties: short and long.

Short Vowels:

|               | Front       | Central | Back   |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------- | ------ |
| **Close**     | i ⟨i⟩ y ⟨u⟩ |         |        |
| Near-close    |             |         |        |
| **Close-mid** | e ⟨e⟩       |         |        |
| Mid           |             | ə ⟨ə⟩   | o̞ ⟨o⟩ |
| **Open-mid**  |             |         |        |
| Near-open     |             |         |        |
| **Open**      |             | ä ⟨a⟩   |        |
Long Vowels:

|               | Front   | Central | Back            |
| ------------- | ------- | ------- | --------------- |
| **Close**     | iː ⟨ii⟩ |         | ɯː ⟨eu⟩ uː ⟨uu⟩ |
| Near-close    | ɪː ⟨ih⟩ |         |                 |
| **Close-mid** | eː ⟨ae⟩ |         |                 |
| Mid           |         |         | o̞ː ⟨oe⟩        |
| **Open-mid**  |         |         |                 |
| Near-open     |         |         |                 |
| **Open**      |         | äː ⟨ah⟩ | ɑː ⟨aa⟩         |
Diphthongs fall under the "Long Vowel" category:
* ei ~ eɪ ⟨ei⟩
* äi ~ äɪ ⟨ai⟩
* oi ~ oɪ ⟨oi⟩
* äu ~ äʊ ⟨au⟩


## 2.3 Allophony

Several phonemes in the language exhibit predictable phonetic variation. These allophones are conditioned by phonetic environment or speech style and do not give rise to phonemic contrasts.

- l between vowels turn into /j/
- h between same vowels turn into /ʔ/
- tʃ turns into /tɕ/ before /j/ or /e/ or /i/
- same with ɕ

## 2.4 Phonotactics

The typical syllable structure of Kelanese is: 

`/(C)(j)V(V)(C)/`

Where:
* C = option consonant onset. Possible consonants:
	`/m, m̥, n, n̥, ŋ, p, t, k, ʔ, ts, tɕ, s, ɕ, ɸ, x, j, l, w, ʍ/`
* j = optional glide, either epenthetic or intervocalic /j/ derived from /l/ between vowels
* V(V) = vowel nucleus, which may be short, long or a diphthong:
	* Short or long vowels:
	`[i, y, u, e, ə, o̞, ä, ɑ, iː, uː, eː, o̞ː, äː, ɯː, ɪː]` as well as the nasalized forms
	* Diphthongs:
	`[ei, äi, o̞i, o̞u, äu]` as well as the nasalized forms
* C (coda) = optional syllable-final consonant:
	`[m, n, ŋ, p̚, t̚, k̚, s, ʃ, l]`

Unreleased stops (/p̚, t̚, k̚/) may resyllabify with a following syllable onset, e.g., `/maplai/ -> [map̚pläi]`

## 2.5 Suprasegmentals

The afformentioned "short" vowels may not appear word-final.
