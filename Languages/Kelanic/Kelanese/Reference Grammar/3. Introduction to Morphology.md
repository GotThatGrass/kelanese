## 3.2 Verbal Morphology

The infinitive or dictionary form of a verb has the **-tel** ending, e.g.:

aitel, kiaktel, zulmantel, poitel, səttel


This is the nominal version of the verb.  

Keltunic verbs **conjugate for tense, but not for person or number**.

### 3.2.4 Notes on Usage

1. Prefixes **stack** freely with tense and aspect markers:
	1. ci- + moh + verb = future continuous
	2. mai + ko- + verb = never have ...ed
2. Continuous prefix `ci-` can combine with any tense suffix (`-n`, `-lah`) to form continuous present or past.
3. Volitional suffix `-soe` can combine with negation or interrogatives for rhetorical or negative volitional forms.
