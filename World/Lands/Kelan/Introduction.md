Kelan is an isolated collection of islands in the middle of the vast [[Cerulean Ocean]], home to a small and less developed population of seafaring and agricultural communities. 
Despite its isolation, the islands are culturally unified by the [[1. Introduction|Kelanese]] language, which serves as a lingua franca across the archipelago.

## Geography

Kelan is made up of numerous islands, ranging from large to small.
The major islands and areas are:

- [[Kelan]]: the main island; largest and central hub of trade and ritual.
- [[Iemae Islands]]: a southeastern cluster of smaller islands; semi-autonomous communities.
- [[Oka Islands]]: a northwestern cluster of islands; sparsely populated, clan-based settlements.
- [[Onaha Islands]]: a southern pair of islands located between Kelan and the Iemae Islands.


## People & Society


## Language

Kelanese, the lingua franca of the archipelago, evolved from Proto-Kelanic roots. While each island retains minor dialectical differences and separate regional languages, Kelanese connects the tongue of all islands.

## Religion & Beliefs

The people of Kelan follow an animist and ancestor-centered religion, centered on the two main birth gods: [[Oka]] and [[Iamae]].
- Oka is associated witht he northwestern islands, fertility, and the protection of clans. The [[Oka Islands]] consider him their guardian, and many rituals and festivals honor his blessings for harvest and family.
